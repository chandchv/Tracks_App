Feature: Edit a next action from every page
  In order to manage a next action
  As a Tracks user
  I want to to be able to change the next action from every page

  Background:
    Given the following user record
      | login    | password | is_admin |
      | testuser | secret   | false    |
    And I have logged in as "testuser" with password "secret"
    And I have a context called "@pc"

  @javascript
  Scenario: I can toggle the star of a todo
    Given I have a todo "star me" in the context "@home"
    When I go to the home page
    And I star the action "star me"
    Then I should see a starred "star me"
    When I go to the tag page for "starred"
    Then I should see "star me"

  @javascript
  Scenario: I can delete a todo
    Given I have a todo "delete me" in the context "@home"
    When I go to the home page
    Then I should see "delete me"
    When I delete the action "delete me"
    Then I should not see "delete me"

  @javascript @wip
  Scenario: Removing the last todo in context will hide context
  # this script fails on https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3075 for selenium-webdriver > 2.14.
  # and selenium-webdriver < 2.20 fails on firefox 11 :-( So @wip for now. This will work on webkit though
    Given I have a todo "delete me" in the context "@home"
    When I go to the home page
    Then I should see the container for context "@home"
    And I should see "delete me" in the context container for "@home"
